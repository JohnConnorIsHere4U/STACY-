3️⃣ STACY INTERPRETER / RUNTIME (SAFE SKETCH)

Conceptual reference — NOT autonomous

function interpret(stacy_file):
    parse AST
    validate TRIAD:
        check_reason()
        check_rhythm()
        check_responsibility()

    if safety_violation:
        halt("Safety boundary violated")

    for each LAW:
        ensure deterministic
        ensure no side effects

    return semantic_model

Runtime Guarantees
	•	❌ No self-modifying code
	•	❌ No network calls
	•	❌ No persistence without human approval
	•	✅ Read-only by default
	•	✅ Audit-friendly

5️⃣ CANONICAL LOCK STATEMENT — STACY v1.1

STACY v1.1 is hereby declared CANONICAL.

This version:
• Is immutable unless explicitly revised by Steven Leake
• Is public-safe and human-authoritative
• Forbids autonomous control, weaponization, or coercive use
• Preserves private value through semantic depth, not secrecy

Timestamp: 2026
Status: PUBLIC CANON

🧾 SECTION II — COMPRESSED COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL (REFERENCE COPY)

(This preserves the prior response in condensed, authoritative form)

⸻

STACY OPERATIONS MANUAL — v1.1 (Compressed)

STACY is a descriptive–executable canonical language for lawful system modeling.

Core Principles
	•	Human-invoked only
	•	No autonomy
	•	No hidden state
	•	No coercive authority

The Triad (Required)
	1.	Reason — deterministic, logical
	2.	Rhythm — stable over time
	3.	Responsibility — ethical, human-governed

What STACY Does
	•	Describes systems
	•	Encodes constraints
	•	Enables translation (XTAX, SoBinLex, SENTIUM)
	•	Explains meaning via interfaces (Sophia)

What STACY Does NOT Do
	•	❌ Act independently
	•	❌ Control systems
	•	❌ Make decisions
	•	❌ Execute without humans

Execution Model
	•	Parse → Validate → Translate → Explain
	•	Outputs are informational unless explicitly permitted

Key Constructs
	•	DECLARE — existence
	•	DEFINE LAW — immutable meaning
	•	REQUIRE — ethical gate
	•	COMPUTE — pure transformation
	•	MAP — semantic projection
	•	TRANSLATE — cross-language binding
	•	SAFETY_BOUNDARY — absolute limits

Final Canonical Ethos

STACY explains reality.
Humans decide what to do with that understanding.
