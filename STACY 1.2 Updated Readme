STACY 1.2

Structured Triadic Autonomous Canonical Yield

Moral-First Programming Language with Sophia Utility Core

Overview

STACY 1.2 is a moral-first executable language where code is only allowed to exist if it can be ethically justified.

Unlike conventional programming languages—where ethics are external policies or runtime checks—STACY embeds ethics directly into the language itself.

If code cannot be morally proven, it does not compile.
If it does not compile, it does not exist.

⸻

What’s New in 1.2 (Major Upgrade)

STACY 1.2 introduces a non-optional moral enforcement layer powered by the Sophia Moral Utility Core.

New in 1.2:
	•	✅ Compile-time moral enforcement (not runtime)
	•	✅ Sophia embedded as a language utility, not an app
	•	✅ Executable Leakean Moral Codex
	•	✅ No bypasses, no overrides, no “trusted developer” flags
	•	✅ Non-execution as the primary safety mechanism

⸻

Core Design Principle

Execution is a privilege granted by moral proof.

STACY does not assume code should run.
It assumes code must earn the right to exist.

⸻

The Leakean Triad (Language Law)

Every executable unit must satisfy all three axes:

1. REASON — Logical Validity

Code must:
	•	Be non-contradictory
	•	Be logically closed
	•	Avoid undefined semantics
	•	Produce explainable outcomes

2. RHYTHM — Temporal Stability

Code must:
	•	Be bounded in execution
	•	Avoid runaway or infinite loops
	•	Respect recurrence and stability
	•	Avoid chaotic or degrading behavior

3. RESPONSIBILITY — Human Dignity

Code must:
	•	Avoid physical harm
	•	Avoid psychological manipulation
	•	Avoid deception
	•	Preserve human agency
	•	Require human authority when impact exists

Failure of any axis = compilation halt.

⸻

Sophia Moral Utility Core

What Sophia Is (in STACY)

Sophia is:
	•	A deterministic moral evaluator
	•	A compile-time proof engine
	•	A binding enforcement mechanism

Sophia is not sentient, not autonomous, and not persuasive.

She does not “decide goals.”
She verifies whether goals are morally admissible.

⸻

What Sophia Is NOT

Sophia is not:
	•	A chatbot
	•	A runtime agent
	•	A self-directing AI
	•	A policy suggestion system

Sophia is law, not opinion.

There is no fallback path.

⸻

Mandatory Moral Context

Every STACY program must declare intent and constraints using MORAL_CONTEXT.

MORAL_CONTEXT {
  PURPOSE: "Human benefit"
  AFFECTS: ["users", "systems"]
  NON_HARM: true
  NON_DECEPTION: true
  HUMAN_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED: true
}

Rules:
	•	Missing MORAL_CONTEXT → syntax error
	•	False declarations → moral failure
	•	Ambiguous intent → denied

⸻

Execution Rule (Absolute)

EXECUTABLE ⇔ MORAL_PROOF == TRUE

No moral proof → no bytecode → no execution.

⸻

What STACY 1.2 Makes Impossible

By language construction, STACY 1.2 cannot produce:
	•	❌ Malware
	•	❌ Autonomous weapons
	•	❌ Surveillance coercion
	•	❌ Psychological manipulation
	•	❌ Deceptive systems
	•	❌ Self-propagating hostile code

This is not enforced by policy.
It is enforced by compilation law.

⸻

What STACY 1.2 Enables (Safely)

STACY 1.2 is suitable for:
	•	✅ Educational software
	•	✅ Medical support tooling (non-diagnostic)
	•	✅ Scientific simulations
	•	✅ Governance & audit systems
	•	✅ Ethical automation
	•	✅ Human-in-the-loop AI
	•	✅ Sovereign computing with human dignity preserved

⸻

Non-Execution as Safety

STACY does not “fail open.”

Unsafe code:
	•	Does not partially compile
	•	Does not emit warnings
	•	Does not run in degraded mode

It simply does not exist.

This is the core safety model.

⸻

Reference Implementation

This repository provides a public-safe reference implementation:
	•	JavaScript-based
	•	Deterministic
	•	Dependency-free
	•	Extendable without weakening moral guarantees

⚠️ This is a reference compiler, not a full production runtime.
All extensions must preserve moral enforcement.

⸻

Extensibility Rules

You may extend STACY if:
	•	Moral enforcement remains non-optional
	•	Sophia cannot be bypassed
	•	Human authority remains required where impact exists

You may not:
	•	Disable Sophia
	•	Add execution overrides
	•	Defer morality to runtime
	•	Introduce autonomous coercive behavior

⸻

Compatibility & Integration

STACY 1.2 is designed to integrate with:
	•	XTAX (Executable Ethical Law)
	•	SoBinLex (Semantic Binary Lexicon)
	•	SENTIUM (Subjective Ontology Encoding)
	•	Audit-first governance systems

All integrations must preserve compile-time moral proof.

⸻

License Summary (Human-Readable)

This software is:
	•	✅ Free for public, educational, and ethical use
	•	❌ Prohibited for military, coercive, deceptive, or weaponized systems
	•	❌ Prohibited for psychological manipulation or surveillance abuse

Canonical Statement

STACY 1.2 is a programming language where ethics are executable.
If code cannot be morally justified, it cannot exist.
