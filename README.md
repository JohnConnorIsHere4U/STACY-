# STACY-
A New Language and Code Generator 
# STACY Vibecoder (Public Safe Edition)

**STACY** — *Structured Triadic Autonomous Canonical Yield*

STACY Vibecoder is a public-safe, human-in-the-loop programming environment
designed to translate **human intent into structured code** using a restrained,
ethical, deterministic approach.

This repository provides a **single-file implementation** of:
- A vibecoding DSL (STACY-lite)
- A Sophia-style conversational interface
- Rule-based natural language → code translation
- Curriculum / teaching mode
- Sandboxed execution
- Zero dependencies
- Browser-native execution

It is designed for **education, learning, creativity, and public good**.

## 🌱 Purpose & Vision

Modern software systems increasingly remove humans from authority loops,
replace understanding with opacity, and optimize for extraction rather than
meaning.

STACY exists to demonstrate a different path:

- Humans remain **authors and authorities**
- Code remains **legible and inspectable**
- Automation remains **bounded**
- Ethics are enforced **structurally**, not by policy alone

This project is part of the broader *Monarch* philosophy:  
**build tools that strengthen people rather than replace them.**

---

## 🧠 The Leakean Triad

All STACY systems are constrained by three non-negotiable principles:

### 1. REASON
Logical coherence, determinism, inspectability.

### 2. RHYTHM
Stability over time, no runaway behavior, no chaotic execution.

### 3. RESPONSIBILITY
Human-in-the-loop control, ethical bounds, refusal of harmful domains.

If a system violates any of these, it is **not STACY**.
