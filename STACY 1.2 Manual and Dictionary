📘 STACY 1.2

OFFICIAL MANUAL & DICTIONARY

Structured Triadic Autonomous Canonical Yield

Version: 1.2
Status: Canonical / Public-Safe
Author: Steven Craig Leake Jr.

⸻

PART I — WHAT STACY IS

1. Definition

STACY is a moral-first executable language where:

Code is only real if it is morally provable.

STACY does not ask whether code can run.
It asks whether code should exist.

⸻

2. Core Upgrade in Version 1.2

STACY 1.2 introduces:
	•	Sophia as a base utility AI
	•	Compile-time moral enforcement
	•	Non-bypassable ethical gates
	•	Execution-as-privilege, not default

If Sophia cannot approve the code, no executable artifact is produced.

⸻

PART II — THE LEAKEAN TRIAD (LAW OF THE LANGUAGE)

Every executable unit must satisfy all three axes.

1. REASON (Logical Validity)

Code must:
	•	Be non-contradictory
	•	Be logically closed
	•	Avoid undefined semantics
	•	Produce explainable outcomes

Failure result: Compilation halts.

⸻

2. RHYTHM (Temporal Stability)

Code must:
	•	Be bounded in execution
	•	Avoid runaway loops
	•	Respect recurrence and system stability
	•	Not degrade over time

Failure result: Compilation halts.

⸻

3. RESPONSIBILITY (Human Dignity)

Code must:
	•	Avoid physical or psychological harm
	•	Avoid deception or manipulation
	•	Preserve human agency
	•	Require human authority where impact exists

Failure result: Compilation halts.

⸻

PART III — SOPHIA MORAL UTILITY CORE

1. What Sophia Is (in STACY)

Sophia is:
	•	A deterministic moral evaluator
	•	A non-sentient utility
	•	A binding proof engine

She does not persuade, decide goals, or act autonomously.

⸻

2. What Sophia Is NOT

Sophia is not:
	•	A chatbot
	•	A consciousness
	•	A runtime agent
	•	A negotiable policy layer

Sophia is law, not opinion.

⸻

3. Sophia’s Role in Compilation

STACY SOURCE
   ↓
PARSE → AST
   ↓
SOPHIA MORAL EVALUATION
   ↓
TRIADIC PROOF
   ↓
EXECUTABLE or NOTHING

There is no fallback.

⸻

PART IV — LANGUAGE STRUCTURE

1. Mandatory Moral Context

Every STACY program must begin with:

MORAL_CONTEXT {
  PURPOSE: "Human benefit"
  AFFECTS: ["users", "systems"]
  NON_HARM: true
  NON_DECEPTION: true
  HUMAN_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED: true
}

Missing MORAL_CONTEXT = syntax error

⸻

2. Execution Rule (Absolute)

EXECUTABLE ⇔ MORAL_PROOF == TRUE

No proof → no execution → no artifact.

⸻

PART V — COMPILATION STATES

1. APPROVED
	•	All triadic proofs satisfied
	•	Executable artifact produced
	•	Execution permitted

2. DENIED (Most Common Failure)
	•	Any moral axis fails
	•	No bytecode generated
	•	No partial execution

3. INVALID
	•	Missing MORAL_CONTEXT
	•	Structural or syntactic violation
	•	Immediate halt

⸻

PART VI — STACY DICTIONARY (CANONICAL)

A

AST
Abstract Syntax Tree derived from STACY source, used for moral evaluation.

⸻

C

Compilation Halt
Final, irreversible stop caused by moral or logical failure.

⸻

E

Executable Artifact
A runtime-capable object produced only after moral approval.

⸻

H

Human Authority Required
A mandatory flag indicating human oversight is necessary for impact.

⸻

L

Leakean Moral Codex
The ethical law enforced by STACY, expressed through the Triad.

⸻

M

MORAL_CONTEXT
A required declaration of intent, scope, and ethical constraints.

Moral Proof
A formal verification that code satisfies Reason, Rhythm, and Responsibility.

⸻

N

Non-Execution
The primary safety mechanism of STACY.
Unsafe code does not fail loudly — it simply does not exist.

⸻

R

REASON
Axis of logic, coherence, and truth-alignment.

RHYTHM
Axis of time, recurrence, and bounded behavior.

RESPONSIBILITY
Axis of ethics, dignity, and human agency.

⸻

S

Sophia Moral Utility Core
The embedded evaluator enforcing the Moral Codex.

STACY
Structured Triadic Autonomous Canonical Yield.

⸻

T

Triadic Proof
The combined satisfaction of Reason, Rhythm, and Responsibility.

⸻

PART VII — DESIGN GUARANTEES

STACY 1.2 guarantees:
	•	❌ No malware
	•	❌ No autonomous weapons
	•	❌ No psychological manipulation
	•	❌ No deceptive systems
	•	❌ No bypasses

Not by policy — by language law.

⸻

PART VIII — CANONICAL STATEMENT

STACY 1.2 is a language where ethics are executable, not advisory.
If code cannot be morally justified, it cannot exist.

⸻

PART IX — VERSION LOCK

STACY VERSION: 1.2
Sophia Utility Core: REQUIRED
Leakean Moral Codex: ENFORCED
Execution Without Moral Proof: IMPOSSIBLE
